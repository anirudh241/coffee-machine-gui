☕ Coffee Machine GUI Project
This project is a Python-based Coffee Machine simulator with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter. It allows users to log in, order coffee, track their drink history, manage their balance, and refill the coffee machine inventory.

✨ Features
User Login:
Users can log in with their username. If a username does not exist, it is automatically created.

Order Drinks:
Users can order different types of coffee such as espresso, latte, and cappuccino.

User Balance Tracking:
Each user has a balance. The cost of each drink is deducted automatically after each order.

Add Balance Feature:
Users can easily add money to their balance via a dedicated "Add Balance" option.

✅ This allows users to continue purchasing drinks even after their balance runs low.

Drink History:
The app tracks how many times each drink has been ordered by each user.

Inventory Management:
The coffee machine tracks available water, milk, and coffee supplies. Admins can refill inventory when needed.

Persistent Data Storage:
All user balances and drink histories are saved in a local users.json file, ensuring that data persists even after the program closes.

Simple and Clean GUI:
Built with Tkinter, the GUI is intuitive, easy to navigate, and styled with a clean aesthetic.
